# Simon Game

Written in vanilla js during holiday because Noah really wanted to have it and the free apps all had anoying adds.
It's so simple I thought why not make it ourselves. And so we did in a few hours by the pool on our holiday ;).

The assets are downloaded randomly from the net and the css is definately not fit for all screen sizes but the game mechanics and sounds
and animations all work nicely. 

Just open index.html and click start button to start playing.
