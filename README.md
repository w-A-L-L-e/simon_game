# Simon Game

Written in vanilla js during holiday because Noah really wanted to have it and the free apps all had anoying adds.
It's so simple I thought why not make it ourselves. And so we did in a few hours by the pool on our holiday ;).

The assets are downloaded randomly from the net and the css is definately not fit for all screen sizes but the game mechanics and sounds
and animations all work nicely.
